Collection of project ideas/techstack that I think are cool

## Project

### Formulaic Onigiri (or 飯糰)
I bought too much rice for this quarter in SF. Give me some easy rice ball recipes or formula to mealprep! There must be some way to modularize and make onigiri more formulaic, like Chipotle for Burritos. 

### Whoscall for the US
Why isn't this a thing? Whoscall is an app that tells you who might be calling you if it's an unknown number. I feel like this makes so much sense but whatever.

### Reddit Sentiment Trading Bot
Memes definitely drive retail investors to some extent. What's the best way to leverage this phenomenon? (1) Become a meme leader (or a pump and dump scammer?) and (2) become a super efficient trader based on meme patterns. I think (2) is definitely more feasible, but that could change once AI can generate memes and effectively control the whole world via memes. 

### Personal Energy Trainer
Problem: I have workaholic tendencies that makes me decide to work having fun, but after almost every trip, date, or just a walk I feel more inspired, motivated, and can focus better.
Solution: Some sort of smart system that can either create an environment to recover this "energy" or encourage me to do these energy recovery activities (probably meditation and walks or other easy tasks to boost productivity/creativity though)
Obstacles: Not too sure how I'll evaluate energy level other than to survey the user how they are feeling (tired, bored, inspired, focused, etc.). Also not sure which solution implementation would work best for me... I really don't want to have another source of distraction that just asks me to do something via email/notification...

### Gesture Tracking as Interface Prototype/Demo for AR

I want to continue my previous MediaPipe project to use as a way to demo/ lofi prototype gesture interface for AR. Especially cool if I can get this to work on Mobile Cardboard VR.
Can use the base code from [Wing](https://github.com/yvanchu/wing).

### Gamified/Gambling App as Consumer Insight Survey

Remember those survey apps that give you $5 for like 10 hours of work? What if we only use prediction questions (Do you think iPhone 13s will sell better than iPhone SE 2s by the end of the month?) and pay out in points that can be redeemed for a tiny bit of money? It'll just be variable rewards so maybe we can pass that as non-gambling apps too? Also pretty sure this idea exists and I just got it from some Instagram ads.

Just kidding, it seems like ~~gambling~~ trading on real life events is already here on [Kalshi](https://kalshi.com).

### Location Tracking App with React Native or Native iOS App
I spent two quarters working on the Collective Experience for Relationship Development project for Design, Technology, Research Lab at Northwestern. I've always said one day I'll rebuild the whole app to make it way better. 

Honestly looking for the day that these features will be so easy to implement that it'll be a week's worth of work for any tech savvy folk to do so and deploy to the app store.

### BearRoom Avalon
Planning to speed run this after the next iteration of BearRoom templates. Goal for the BearRoom template is to keep implementing a game like this to be under a week for a developer like me (college student w self-taught react exp)

### 100Ads
It's a leaderboard of people who've paid the most money to me. That's it. Each donor can attach an image during the donation process, and the highest single donation will have the top space on the website, the second highest will have the second, you get the idea. Idea credit goes to Dan Hu, a great friend.

### Who am I?
Ever wonder how much data websites can extract from you in a single "Agree" click? Come click on ours and find out ;)

### Poker game information aggregator
Like poker atlas for Taiwan. Games are currently gated behind google map/facebook/thread searches plus a line groupchat. Not to mention the amount of dead links. An information aggregator will definitely make it easier for new players to discover poker games

## Techstack 

### [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev) + Typescript
Fast, simple, server-side rendered web techstack that uses some of the best modern web techstack just seems too cool for me to pass. Maybe I'll redo my sad WordPress-ported portfolio into this :think:

### GPT-3 and Dall-e
It's just so cool! Maybe something that

### PeerJs + Animations (not sure which techstack? or just simple CSS/JS?) for BearRoom games
For the realtime board games, yknow?

### next.JS
Seems like it'll be a useful react tech stack to learn! Currently working on [Compativibes](https://github.com/joelyoshiya/compativibes)
